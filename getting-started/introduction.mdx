### **What is zkPass**

zkPass is a decentralized oracle protocol that transforms private internet data into verifiable proofs on-chain. Built on **zkTLS** — a novel integration of 3P-TLS and Hybrid-ZK cryptography — zkPass enables users and applications to prove facts derived from any HTTPS website without requiring OAuth, API keys, or trusted intermediaries.

Through zkPass, individuals can selectively prove attributes across a wide range of data domains, including:

- **Legal identity** (passport, driver’s license, national ID)
- **Financial records** (account balances, transaction history, credit scores)
- **Healthcare information** (medical records, prescriptions, genetic data)
- **Social and behavioral data** (social media accounts, activity proofs)
- **Professional and educational background** (employment history, diplomas, certifications)
- **Digital activity and assets** (gaming accounts, loyalty programs, real-world assets)

All proofs are generated locally in the user’s browser or device, ensuring that raw personal data is never exposed or transmitted. These verifiable proofs can be integrated into a broad spectrum of use cases spanning **AI, DePIN, digital identity (DID), DeFi lending, governance, compliance, and beyond**.

### **Why zkPass**

zkPass introduces a new verification paradigm that addresses the limitations of existing identity and data solutions:

1. **Privacy-Preserving** Sensitive user data never leaves the device. Proofs reveal only the attributes required for verification.
2. **Verifiable Integrity** zkTLS extends the standard TLS protocol into a three-party model, ensuring the provenance and authenticity of private data.
3. **Universal Compatibility** Works with any HTTPS website, without requiring OAuth APIs, commercial licenses, or custom integrations.
4. **Anti-Cheating** Template-based verification ensures that client requests and server responses cannot be manipulated. Users cannot falsify achievements or credentials.
5. **Efficient Proof Generation** Powered by the **VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH)** algorithm, zkPass enables millisecond-level proof generation directly on local devices, producing proofs that remain publicly verifiable.
6. **Trustless Attestations** Decentralized MPC nodes verify data integrity before a proof is accepted, guaranteeing that zkSBTs and attestations cannot be forged.

### **Public vs. Private Data**

zkPass is designed to bridge the gap between **publicly accessible information** and **private, user-controlled data**:

- **Public Data**: Information already open and accessible, such as census statistics, weather data, or government-published records. While useful for transparency, this data typically lacks individual-level granularity and is not privacy-sensitive.
- **Private Data**: Personally identifiable or sensitive information that belongs to individuals or organizations, such as identity documents, bank records, medical histories, or proprietary business data. Private data is subject to strict legal protections and requires cryptographic guarantees before it can be shared or validated.

zkPass provides the cryptographic framework for turning private data into **privacy-preserving proofs of authenticity**, allowing both public and private data to become part of a verifiable, interoperable digital ecosystem.
