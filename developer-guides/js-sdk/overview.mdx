Welcome to the zkPass Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation. This SDK is designed to help third-party Decentralized Applications (DApps) integrate seamlessly with the zkPass TransGate browser extension or app. With the SDK, developers can easily connect their DApps to zkPass, enabling users to privately and selectively validate data on any HTTPS website within the web3 ecosystem.

The SDK provides support for standard functionalities, including trust verifications for legal identity, financial records, healthcare information, social interactions, work experience, education, and skill certifications. Furthermore, it continually expands its capabilities, with additional features anticipated in future updates.

The following instructions are applicable to web DApps based on JavaScript.
