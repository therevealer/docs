zkPass extends verifiability across the digital world by transforming sensitive Web2 data into cryptographic proofs that are portable, privacy-preserving, and universally verifiable. Built on the zkTLS protocol, zkPass creates a trust layer where information can prove itself without being exposed, bridging the gap between Web2 institutions and Web3 applications.

The use cases of zkPass can be organized into ten domains, each addressing critical challenges where authenticity, privacy, and interoperability are essential:

## Strategic Impact

Across these domains, zkPass consistently replaces the need to disclose raw data with cryptographic attestations rooted in authoritative sources. This delivers three transformative outcomes:

1. **For individuals**: sovereignty over personal and professional data, with control over what is disclosed and where.
2. **For enterprises** and institutions: reduced liability, compliance efficiency, and assurance of data authenticity.
3. **For ecosystems**: new classes of applications where trust and privacy are not trade-offs but complementary guarantees.

zkPass positions itself as the universal verification layer of the digital era. By embedding verifiability into the fabric of online interaction, it enables an internet where authenticity is native, privacy is preserved, and trust is grounded in mathematics rather than intermediaries.
