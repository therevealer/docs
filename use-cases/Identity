Identity verification and regulatory compliance are two of the most demanding areas in digital infrastructure.
Existing approaches depend heavily on centralized intermediaries that store sensitive personal data, creating significant risks of privacy leakage,
data breaches, and regulatory inefficiency. zkPass, through its zkTLS protocol, offers a cryptographically verifiable yet privacy-preserving alternative.
By enabling individuals to prove compliance attributes directly from authoritative Web2 sources,
zkPass allows institutions and applications to validate what matters while ensuring that raw data never leaves the user’s control.
