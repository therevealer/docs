title: "Supply Chain and Enterprise Data"
---

Global supply chains and enterprise systems manage sensitive commercial information ranging from invoices to certificates of origin. Current verification methods depend on centralized registries and paper-based audits, which are costly, slow, and vulnerable to forgery.

zkPass introduces cryptographic verification for enterprise and supply chain data, enabling selective disclosure of compliance attributes without exposing full documents.

**Limitations of current supply chain systems**

- Paper-based certificates subject to forgery and duplication.
- Limited interoperability between enterprise systems and regulators.
- Data silos preventing real-time verification across logistics networks.

**zkPass approach**

- zkTLS proofs generated directly from enterprise systems such as ERP, logistics platforms, or customs databases.
- Selective disclosure of compliance attributes such as “organic certified,” “origin country = Japan,” or “batch temperature maintained.”
- Proofs portable across regulators, partners, and end-users.

**Applications**

- Authenticity verification of luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, or critical components.
- Compliance proofs for carbon accounting, environmental standards, or labor certifications.
- Trade finance verification of invoices, bills of lading, and letters of credit without exposing sensitive details.

**Strategic impact** zkPass enables global supply chains to achieve transparency without compromising commercial confidentiality. This strengthens trust between enterprises, regulators, and consumers while reducing fraud and compliance costs.
