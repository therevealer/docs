Governments are digitizing identity, taxation, and welfare distribution, but adoption is limited by privacy concerns and lack of interoperability. Citizens are forced to disclose full personal data to access services, creating inefficiency and vulnerability to misuse.

zkPass enables verifiable yet privacy-preserving interactions between citizens and public institutions. Through zkTLS, official government portals become sources of cryptographic proofs that can be reused across multiple services.

**Limitations of current government systems**

- Heavy reliance on centralized ID registries and document storage.
- Privacy risks from mass surveillance or data breaches.
- High administrative costs due to redundant verification processes.

**zkPass approach**

- zkTLS proofs generated from e-government portals such as tax systems, healthcare registries, or digital ID databases.
- Attribute-based disclosure, proving eligibility or status without revealing unnecessary details.
- Cross-institution interoperability, reducing administrative duplication.

**Applications**

- Proof of eligibility for social welfare programs without revealing full income history.
- Verification of tax compliance for businesses interacting with regulators.
- Digital passport or driver’s license proofs consumable by both online and offline services.

**Strategic impact** zkPass allows governments to deliver efficient, privacy-respecting digital services. For citizens, this ensures dignity and data sovereignty. For states, it enhances trust, reduces fraud, and lowers administrative burdens.
