title: "Reputation and Achievements"
---

Reputation is a critical dimension of trust in both digital and real-world ecosystems. From professional credentials to gaming achievements and community contributions, individuals and organizations build reputational capital that influences access, opportunity, and credibility. Yet most reputation systems are siloed, unverifiable, and vulnerable to manipulation. zkPass, through zkTLS, enables reputation and achievements to be captured as verifiable proofs from authoritative Web2 sources and made portable across Web3 and institutional contexts.

#### **Limitations of Current Reputation Models**

- **Fragmentation**: Achievements and credentials are locked within closed platforms such as universities, employers, or gaming providers, without interoperability.
- **Manipulation**: Reputation scores on Web2 platforms are often inflated by bots, fake reviews, or unverifiable claims.
- **Privacy leakage**: Sharing full resumes, certificates, or transcripts exposes sensitive personal data that may be unnecessary for verification.
- **Lack of composability**: On-chain reputation systems are limited to Web3-native interactions, ignoring the vast body of verifiable Web2 data.

#### **zkPass Approach**

zkPass redefines reputation as a cryptographic asset. By connecting to Web2 platforms via zkTLS, users can generate proofs of achievements, credentials, or history that are portable, privacy-preserving, and verifiable anywhere. Instead of exporting raw resumes or certificates, zkPass enables selective proofs that reveal only what is necessary for the interaction.

Core properties:

- **Verifiable authenticity**: Credentials originate from authoritative Web2 sources such as universities, gaming platforms, or professional networks.
- **Selective disclosure**: Proofs disclose only the required claim (for example, “completed advanced course,” “achieved level 50,” “employed at company X”), without revealing unrelated information.
- **Composability**: Reputation proofs can be aggregated across domains and reused across ecosystems, forming a cumulative profile.
- **Resistance to Sybil attacks**: By grounding achievements in real, verifiable accounts, zkPass prevents the creation of fake identities or inflated reputation.

### **Applications**

**On-chain Achievements**

- Academic records: Verified proofs of course completion, degrees, or certifications from platforms such as Coursera, edX, or universities.
- Professional milestones: Employment history or contributions on LinkedIn or GitHub transformed into verifiable on-chain credentials.
- Lifestyle and consumer engagement: Travel history, brand memberships, or loyalty points exported as reputation assets.
- Gaming achievements: Verified progression or rankings from Web2 gaming platforms such as Steam or Epic used as credentials in Web3 gaming ecosystems.

**Experience Checks**

- Recruitment: Employers can verify work experience or academic background without requesting raw transcripts or CVs.
- Freelancing and gig economy: Platforms such as Upwork or Fiverr can integrate zkPass to ensure that listed skills and cryptographic proofs back work history.
- DAO and community tasks: Communities can restrict task allocations or rewards to contributors with verified skill sets or credentials.

## **Strategic Impact**

By converting Web2 reputation into portable, verifiable credentials, zkPass enables:

- **For individuals**: control over personal achievements and the ability to selectively disclose them across platforms.
- **For enterprises**: reliable hiring, collaboration, and credential verification without costly manual checks.
- **For Web3 ecosystems**: stronger reputation systems that go beyond wallet activity and integrate real-world achievements.

This redefines reputation as a cryptographic primitive that is reusable, interoperable, and privacy-preserving, unlocking new forms of trust across digital and physical economies.
