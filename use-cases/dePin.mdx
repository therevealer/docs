title: "DePIN and Machine Economy"
---

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) rely on devices and machines to generate data that is used for payments, reputation, and coordination. Without trustworthy verification, these systems are exposed to falsified reports, double-counting, and manipulation.

zkPass enables device-generated data to be cryptographically verifiable. By embedding zkTLS at the device gateway or cloud API, machine interactions can produce zero-knowledge proofs of usage, availability, or performance.

**Limitations of current DePIN systems**

- Dependence on centralized APIs or unverifiable self-reports from devices.
- Fraud in usage metrics such as fake bandwidth, storage, or energy contributions.
- Difficulty in establishing reliable machine-to-machine settlements.

**zkPass approach**

- TLS-based attestation of device data, transformed into zero-knowledge proofs.
- Local proof generation at edge gateways or device APIs, preventing manipulation.
- Interoperable proofs consumable by blockchains, DAOs, and marketplaces.

**Applications**

- Verifiable proofs of energy consumption and delivery in decentralized power grids.
- Authentic bandwidth or storage usage proofs in decentralized cloud networks.
- Verified EV charging sessions, enabling fair rewards in charging infrastructure networks.
- IoT-enabled supply chain sensors providing cryptographic proofs of environmental conditions.

**Strategic impact** By anchoring machine data in verifiable cryptographic proofs, zkPass acts as the trust layer for the machine economy. This ensures that incentives, settlements, and governance in DePIN systems are based on authentic inputs rather than unverifiable claims.
